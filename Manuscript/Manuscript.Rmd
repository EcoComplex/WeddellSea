\introduction[Introduction]

Introduction text goes here. You can change the name of the section if
necessary using `\introduction[modified heading]`.

The following settings can or must be configured in the header of this
file and are bespoke for Copernicus manuscripts:

-   The `journal` you are submitting to using the official abbreviation.
    You can use the function
    `rticles::copernicus_journal_abbreviations(name = '...')` to search
    the existing journals.

-   Specific sections of the manuscript:

    -   `running` with `title` and `author`

    -   `competinginterests`

    -   `copyrightstatement` (optional)

    -   `availability` (strongly recommended if any used), one of
        `code`, `data`, or `codedata`

    -   `authorcontribution`

    -   `disclaimer`

    -   `acknowledgements`

See the defaults and examples from the skeleton and the official
Copernicus documentation for details.

**Please note:** Per [their
guidelines](https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html),
Copernicus does not support additional \LaTeX{} packages or new \LaTeX{}
commands than those defined in their `.cls` file. This means that you
cannot add any extra dependencies and a warning will be thrown if so.\
This extends to syntax highlighting of source code. Therefore this
template sets the parameter `highlight` in the YAML header to `NULL` to
deactivate Pandoc syntax highlighter. This prevent addition of external
packages for highlighting inserted by Pandoc. However, it might be
desirable to have syntax highlight available in preprints or for others
reasons. Please see `?rmarkdown::pdf_document` for available options to
activate highlighting.

The objective of this work was twofold: 1) estimate the strength for each interaction in the Weddell Sea food web, and 2) determine key trophic species considering weighted and unweighted properties and the influence on the stability of the network.


# Methodology

## Study area

The high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf is situated between 74 and 78ºS with a length of approximately 450 km (Figure 1). Water depth varies from 200 to 500 m. Shallower areas are covered by continental ice, which forms the coastline along the eastern and southern part of the Weddell Sea. The shelf area contains a complex three-dimensional habitat with large biomass, intermediate to high diversity in comparison to benthic boreal communities and a spatially patchy distribution of organisms [@Dayton1990; @Teixido2002].

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Map of the Weddell Sea and Dronning Maud Land sector highlighting the high Antarctic shelf as a dashed-line contour. Modified from www.soos.aq."}
knitr::include_graphics("WeddellSea_map.jpg")
```

## Weddell Sea food web dataset

We obtained the dataset of the Weddell Sea food web from the GlobAL daTabasE of traits and food Web Architecture (GATEWAy, version 1.0) of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig [@Brose2018]. This open access database is a list of predator-prey interactions that describe several highly-resolved food webs, including biological data about the consumer and resource involved in each trophic interaction (i.e. mean mass). Furthermore, it incorporates information on the interaction itself, such as the dimensionality.
This marine food web compiles all the food web data available for the high Antarctic Weddell Sea collected 
since 1983, and is one of the most highly-resolved marine food webs documented to date. It's noteworthy that it is a 
summary network that ignores seasonal changes [@Jacob2011].

## Data set analyses

Text here.

### Interaction strength estimation

To estimate the strength of each interaction in the food web, we followed the methodology proposed by @Pawar2012.

### Species properties

In order to characterize the species, we considered weighted and unweighted properties (Figure 2). The former is based on the estimation of the interaction strength described in the previous section. The latter is related to properties commonly used in qualitative (presence/absence of interaction) food web studies [@Martinez1991; @Dunne2002; @Borrelli2014]. As weighted property we used the mean interaction strength, meaning the average strength of all species interactions. As unweighted properties we used: a) degree or the total number of trophic interactions taking into account in- and out-interactions (role as predator and prey, respectively); b) trophic level or the position in the food web relative to primary producers/detritus; and c) trophic similarity or the measurement of trophic overlap between species based on shared and unique resources and consumers.

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Scheme of a network showing the weighted and unweighted properties we used to characterize the species of the Weddell Sea food web."}
knitr::include_graphics("ToyFoodWeb.jpg")
```

### Stability and extinction simulations

Quasi-Sign Stability (QSS) [@Allesina2008].
After each species extinction, we calculated the QSS for the food web minus one species and compared it with the QSS for the whole network. We statistically analysed such difference applying the Anderson-Darling test [@Scholz1987].

# Results

The Weddell Sea food web comprises 490 species and 16041 predator-prey interactions (Figure 3).

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Graphic representation of the Weddell Sea food web. Species (nodes) are arranged verticaly and colored by trophic level. The diameter of the node indicates the total number of interactions. Predator-prey interactions are represented by the arrows, from the prey to the predator."}
knitr::include_graphics("WeddellSea_net.jpg")
```

# Content section with R code chunks

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sum <- 1 + 41
```

You should always use `echo = FALSE` on R Markdown code blocks as they
add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus. The hidden
workflow results in `r sum`.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using
```` ``` ```` without additional instructions.

    sum <- 1 + 41

## FIGURES

When figures and tables are placed at the end of the MS (article in
one-column style), please add \clearpage between bibliography and first
table and/or figure as well as between each table and/or figure.

### ONE-COLUMN FIGURES

```{r, out.width = "8.3cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "one column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

### TWO-COLUMN FIGURES


```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "two column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

## TABLES

You can add \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template
requirements.

### ONE-COLUMN TABLE

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[t]

## MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

All papers typeset by Copernicus Publications follow the math
typesetting regulations given by the IUPAC Green Book (IUPAC:
Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Blackwell
Science, available at:
<http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf>,
1993).

Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T
for Temperature)

Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b,
c)

Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)

Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in
roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)

Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)

Vectors are identified in bold italic font using \vec{x}

Matrices are identified in bold roman font

Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands `\times` (for
vector products, grids, and exponential notations) or `\cdot`

The character \* should not be applied as mutliplication sign

## EQUATIONS

### Single-row equation

Unnumbered equations (i.e. using `$$` and getting inline preview in
RStudio) are not supported by Copernicus.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
\end{equation}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  
\end{equation}
```
### Multiline equation

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8
\end{align}
```
## MATRICES

$$
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## ALGORITHM/PROGRAMMING CODE

If you want to use algorithms, you need to make sure yourself that the
\LaTeX packages `algorithms` and `algorithmicx` are installed so that
`algorithm.sty` respectively `algorithmic.sty` can be loaded by the
Copernicus template. Both need to be available through your preferred
\LaTeX{} distribution. With TinyTeX (or TeX Live), you can do so by
running `tinytex::tlmgr_install(c("algorithms", "algorithmicx"))`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = tinytex::is_tinytex()}
tinytex::tlmgr_install(c("algorithms", "algorithmicx"))
```

Copernicus staff will no accept any additional packages from your LaTeX
source code, so please stick to these two acceptable packages. They are
needed to use the example below

```{=tex}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
\IF {$i\geq 5$} 
        \STATE $i\gets i-1$
\ELSE
        \IF {$i\leq 3$}
                \STATE $i\gets i+2$
        \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```
## CHEMICAL FORMULAS AND REACTIONS

For formulas embedded in the text, please use `\chem{}`, e.g.
\chem{A \rightarrow B}.

The reaction environment creates labels including the letter R, i.e.
(R1), (R2), etc.

-   `\rightarrow` should be used for normal (one-way) chemical reactions

-   `\rightleftharpoons` should be used for equilibria

-   `\leftrightarrow` should be used for resonance structures

```{=tex}
\begin{reaction}
A \rightarrow B \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Coper \rightleftharpoons nicus \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Publi \leftrightarrow cations
\end{reaction}
```
## PHYSICAL UNITS

Please use `\unit{}` (allows to save the math/`$` environment) and apply
the exponential notation, for example $3.14\,\unit{km\,h^{-1}}$ (using
LaTeX mode: `\( 3.14\,\unit{...} \)`) or \unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}} (using
only `\unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}}`).
