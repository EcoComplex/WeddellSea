\textbf{Please note:} Per
\href{https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html}{their
guidelines}, Copernicus does not support additional \LaTeX{} packages or
new \LaTeX{} commands than those defined in their \texttt{.cls} file.
This means that you cannot add any extra dependencies and a warning will
be thrown if so.\\
This extends to syntax highlighting of source code. Therefore this
template sets the parameter \texttt{highlight} in the YAML header to
\texttt{NULL} to deactivate Pandoc syntax highlighter. This prevent
addition of external packages for highlighting inserted by Pandoc.
However, it might be desirable to have syntax highlight available in
preprints or for others reasons. Please see
\texttt{?rmarkdown::pdf\_document} for available options to activate
highlighting.

The objective of this work was twofold: 1) estimate the strength for
each interaction in the Weddell Sea food web, and 2) determine key
trophic species considering weighted and unweighted properties and the
influence on the stability of the network.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Study area}

The high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf is situated between 74 and 78ºS
with a length of approximately 450 km (Figure 1). Water depth varies
from 200 to 500 m. Shallower areas are covered by continental ice, which
forms the coastline along the eastern and southern part of the Weddell
Sea. The shelf area contains a complex three-dimensional habitat with
large biomass, intermediate to high diversity in comparison to benthic
boreal communities and a spatially patchy distribution of organisms
\citep{Dayton1990, Teixido2002}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Weddell Sea food web dataset}

We obtained the dataset of the Weddell Sea food web from the GlobAL
daTabasE of traits and food Web Architecture (GATEWAy, version 1.0) of
the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)
Halle-Jena-Leipzig \citep{Brose2018}. This open access database is a
list of predator-prey interactions that contains several highly-resolved
food webs, including biological data about the consumer and resource
species involved in each trophic interaction (i.e.~mean mass).
Furthermore, it incorporates information on the interaction itself, such
as the dimensionality. This marine food web compiles all the food web
data available for the high Antarctic Weddell Sea collected since 1983,
and is one of the most highly-resolved marine food webs documented to
date. It's noteworthy that it is a summary network that ignores seasonal
changes \citep{Jacob2011}.

\subsection{Dataset analyses}

We studied the food web of the Weddell Sea by: a) estimating the
strength of each interaction; b) analysing the properties of the species
in a network approach; and c) comparing the stability of the food web
after performing extinction simulations.

\subsubsection{Interaction strength estimation}

To estimate the strength of each interaction in the food web, we
followed the methodology proposed by \citet{Pawar2012}. The minimum data
requirements are: body mass of the consumer (predator) and resource
(prey), and the interaction dimensionality classified as 2 or 3
dimensions. GATEWAy v.1.0 does provide information on the mean mass for
consumers and resources (except for `detritus' and `sediment') for every
interaction, but lacks the dimensionality for 924 interactions. To solve
this issue, we used the information about movement type for consumer and
resource. Then, we classified the interaction as 2D when both consumer
and resource move in 2D (e.g., both are sessile or walking) or if a
consumer moves in 3D and a resource in 2D (e.g., swimming consumer and
sessile/walking resource). The interaction was classified as 3D when
both consumer and resource move in 3D (e.g., both swimming) or if the
consumer moves in 2D and resource in 3D (e.g., sessile/walking consumer,
swimming resource) \citep{Pawar2012}.

The main equation we used for estimating the interaction strength IS is
\citep{Pawar2012}:

\begin{equation}
IS = \alpha x_R \frac{m_R}{m_C}
\end{equation}

where \vec{\alpha} is the search rate, \vec{x_R} is the density of the
resource, and \vec{m_R} and \vec{m_C} are the body mass of the resource
and the consumer, respectively.

We obtained estimations for the resource density and the search rate
from the scaling relationships with the resource and the consumer mass,
respectively (\citet{Pawar2012}). The coefficients of such
relationships, determined by ordinary least squares regression, vary
with the interaction dimensionality. On one hand, resource density
scales with resource mass as a power-law with exponents
\vec{p = -0.79 \pm 0.09} in 2D and \vec{p = -0.86 \pm 0.06} in 3D. Since
mean mass for resources `detritus' and `sediment' were not available in
GATEWAy v.1.0, we calculated it considering the scaling relationship
with consumer mass, also different in 2D and 3D (for details see
equation S9 and figures 2c-d of Supplementary Information in
\citet{Pawar2012}). On the other hand, search rate scales with consumer
mass as a power-law with exponents \vec{p = 0.68 \pm 0.12} in 2D and
\vec{p = 1.05 \pm 0.08} in 3D.

\subsubsection{Species properties}

In order to characterize the species, we considered weighted and
unweighted properties (Figure 2). The former is based on the estimation
of the interaction strength described in the previous section. The
latter is related to properties commonly used in qualitative
(presence/absence of interaction) food web studies
\citep{Martinez1991, Dunne2002, Borrelli2014}. As weighted property we
used the mean interaction strength, meaning the average strength of all
species interactions. As unweighted properties we used: a) degree or the
total number of trophic interactions taking into account in- and
out-interactions (role as predator and prey, respectively); b) trophic
level or the position in the food web relative to primary
producers/detritus; and c) trophic similarity or the measurement of
trophic overlap between species based on shared and unique resources and
consumers.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{ToyFoodWeb} \caption{Scheme of a network showing the weighted and unweighted properties we used to characterize the species of the Weddell Sea food web.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stability and extinction simulations}

Quasi-Sign Stability (QSS) \citep{Allesina2008}. After each species
extinction, we calculated the QSS for the food web minus one species and
compared it with the QSS for the whole network. We statistically
analysed such difference applying the Anderson-Darling test
\citep{Scholz1987}.

\section{Results}

The Weddell Sea food web comprises 490 species and 16041 predator-prey
interactions (Figure 3).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{WeddellSea_net} \caption{Graphic representation of the Weddell Sea food web. Species (nodes) are arranged verticaly and colored by trophic level. The diameter of the node indicates the total number of interactions. Predator-prey interactions are represented by the arrows, from the prey to the predator.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{figure}

\section{Content section with R code chunks}

You should always use \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} on R Markdown code blocks
as they add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus. The hidden
workflow results in 42.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}} without
additional instructions.

\begin{verbatim}
sum <- 1 + 41
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{EQUATIONS}

\subsubsection{Single-row equation}

Unnumbered equations (i.e.~using \texttt{\$\$} and getting inline
preview in RStudio) are not supported by Copernicus.

\begin{equation}
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  
\end{equation}

\end{align}

\subsection{MATRICES}

\[
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
\]

\subsection{ALGORITHM/PROGRAMMING CODE}

If you want to use algorithms, you need to make sure yourself that the
\LaTeX packages \texttt{algorithms} and \texttt{algorithmicx} are
installed so that \texttt{algorithm.sty} respectively
\texttt{algorithmic.sty} can be loaded by the Copernicus template. Both
need to be available through your preferred \LaTeX{} distribution. With
TinyTeX (or TeX Live), you can do so by running
\texttt{tinytex::tlmgr\_install(c("algorithms",\ "algorithmicx"))}

\begin{verbatim}
## tlmgr update --all --self
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## tlmgr install algorithms algorithmicx
\end{verbatim}

Copernicus staff will no accept any additional packages from your LaTeX
source code, so please stick to these two acceptable packages. They are
needed to use the example below

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
\IF {$i\geq 5$} 
        \STATE $i\gets i-1$
\ELSE
        \IF {$i\leq 3$}
                \STATE $i\gets i+2$
        \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{CHEMICAL FORMULAS AND REACTIONS}

For formulas embedded in the text, please use
\texttt{\textbackslash{}chem\{\}}, e.g. \chem{A \rightarrow B}.

The reaction environment creates labels including the letter R, i.e.
(R1), (R2), etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}rightarrow} should be used for normal
  (one-way) chemical reactions
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}rightleftharpoons} should be used for
  equilibria
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}leftrightarrow} should be used for resonance
  structures
\end{itemize}

\begin{reaction}
A \rightarrow B \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Coper \rightleftharpoons nicus \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Publi \leftrightarrow cations
\end{reaction}

\subsection{PHYSICAL UNITS}

Please use \texttt{\textbackslash{}unit\{\}} (allows to save the
math/\texttt{\$} environment) and apply the exponential notation, for
example \(3.14\,\unit{km\,h^{-1}}\) (using LaTeX mode:
\texttt{\textbackslash{}(\ 3.14\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}unit\{...\}\ \textbackslash{})})
or \unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}} (using only
\texttt{\textbackslash{}unit\{0.872\textbackslash{},m\textbackslash{},s\^{}\{-1\}\}}).
