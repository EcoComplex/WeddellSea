\textbf{Please note:} Per
\href{https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html}{their
guidelines}, Copernicus does not support additional \LaTeX{} packages or
new \LaTeX{} commands than those defined in their \texttt{.cls} file.
This means that you cannot add any extra dependencies and a warning will
be thrown if so.\\
This extends to syntax highlighting of source code. Therefore this
template sets the parameter \texttt{highlight} in the YAML header to
\texttt{NULL} to deactivate Pandoc syntax highlighter. This prevent
addition of external packages for highlighting inserted by Pandoc.
However, it might be desirable to have syntax highlight available in
preprints or for others reasons. Please see
\texttt{?rmarkdown::pdf\_document} for available options to activate
highlighting.

\textbf{Important}: Always double-check with the official manuscript
preparation guidelines at
\url{https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/manuscript_preparation.html},
especially the sections ``Technical instructions for LaTeX'' and
``Manuscript composition''. Please contact Daniel Nüst,
\texttt{daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de}, with any problems.

The objective of this work was twofold: 1) estimate the strength for
each interaction in the Weddell Sea food web, and 2) determine key
trophic species considering weighted and unweighted properties and the
influence on the stability of the network.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Study area}

The high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf is situated between 74 and 78ºS
with a length of approximately 450 km. Water depth varies from 200 to
500 m. Shallower areas are covered by continental ice, which forms the
coastline along the eastern and southern part of the Weddell Sea. The
shelf area contains a complex three-dimensional habitat with large
biomass, intermediate to high diversity in comparison to benthic boreal
communities and a spatially patchy distribution of organisms
\citep[\citet{Teixido2002}]{Dayton1990}.

Add Figure of map.

\subsection{Weddell Sea food web data set}

We obtained the data set of the Weddell Sea food web from the GlobAL
daTabasE of traits and food Web Architecture (GATEWAy, version 1.0) of
the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)
Halle-Jena-Leipzig \citep{Brose2018}. This marine food web, which
includes all the food web data available for the high Antarctic Weddell
Sea collected since 1983, is one of the most highly resolved marine food
webs documented to date. It's noteworthy that it is a summary network
that ignores seasonal changes \citep{Jacob2011}.

\subsection{Data set analyses}

Text here.

\subsubsection{Interaction strength estimation}

To estimate the strength of each interaction in the food web, we
followed the methodology proposed by \citet{Pawar2012}.

\subsubsection{Species properties}

In order to characterize the species, we considered weighted and
unweighted properties. The former is based on the estimation of the
interaction strength described in the previous section. The latter is
related to properties commonly used in qualitative (presence/absence of
interaction) food web studies \citep[\citet{Dunne2002},
\citet{Borrelli2014}]{Martinez1991}. As weighted property we used the
mean interaction strength, meaning the average strength of all species
interactions. As unweighted properties we used: a) degree or the total
number of trophic interactions taking into account in- and
out-interactions (role as predator and prey, respectively); b) trophic
level or the position in the food web relative to primary
producers/detritus; and c) trophic similarity or the measurement of
trophic overlap between species based on shared and unique resources and
consumers.

Add Figure of toy food web.

\subsubsection{Stability and extinction simulations}

Quasi-Sign Stability (QSS) \citep{Allesina2008}. After each species
extinction, we calculated the QSS for the food web minus one species and
compared it with the QSS for the whole network. We statistically
analysed such difference applying the Anderson-Darling test
\citep{Scholz1987}.

\section{Results}

See the
\href{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html}{R
Markdown docs for bibliographies and citations}.

Copernicus supports biblatex and a sample bibliography is in file
\texttt{WeddellSea.bib}. Read \citep{Pawar2012}, and
\citep[see][]{Dirac1953888}.

\section{Content section with R code chunks}

You should always use \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} on R Markdown code blocks
as they add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus. The hidden
workflow results in 42.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}} without
additional instructions.

\begin{verbatim}
sum <- 1 + 41
\end{verbatim}

\section{Discussion}

If you want to insert a list, you must

\begin{itemize}
\item
  leave
\item
  empty lines
\item
  between each list item
\end{itemize}

because the \texttt{\textbackslash{}tightlist} format used by R Markdown
is not supported in the Copernicus template. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
- leave

- empty lines

- between each list item
\end{verbatim}

\section{Examples from the official template}

\subsection{FIGURES}

When figures and tables are placed at the end of the MS (article in
one-column style), please add \clearpage between bibliography and first
table and/or figure as well as between each table and/or figure.

\subsubsection{ONE-COLUMN FIGURES}

Include a 12cm width figure of Nikolaus Copernicus from
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg}{Wikipedia}
with caption using R Markdown.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{Nikolaus_Kopernikus} \caption{one column figure}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{TWO-COLUMN FIGURES}

You can also include a larger figure.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Nikolaus_Kopernikus} \caption{two column figure}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{TABLES}

You can add \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template
requirements.

\subsubsection{ONE-COLUMN TABLE}

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table Footnotes}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{TWO-COLUMN TABLE}

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table footnotes}
\end{table*}

\subsection{MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS}

All papers typeset by Copernicus Publications follow the math
typesetting regulations given by the IUPAC Green Book (IUPAC:
Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Blackwell
Science, available at:
\url{http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf},
1993).

Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T
for Temperature)

Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b,
c)

Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)

Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in
roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)

Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)

Vectors are identified in bold italic font using \vec{x}

Matrices are identified in bold roman font

Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands
\texttt{\textbackslash{}times} (for vector products, grids, and
exponential notations) or \texttt{\textbackslash{}cdot}

The character * should not be applied as mutliplication sign

\subsection{EQUATIONS}

\subsubsection{Single-row equation}

Unnumbered equations (i.e.~using \texttt{\$\$} and getting inline
preview in RStudio) are not supported by Copernicus.

\begin{equation}
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multiline equation}

\begin{align}
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8
\end{align}

\subsection{MATRICES}

\[
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
\]

\subsection{ALGORITHM/PROGRAMMING CODE}

If you want to use algorithms, you need to make sure yourself that the
\LaTeX packages \texttt{algorithms} and \texttt{algorithmicx} are
installed so that \texttt{algorithm.sty} respectively
\texttt{algorithmic.sty} can be loaded by the Copernicus template. Both
need to be available through your preferred \LaTeX{} distribution. With
TinyTeX (or TeX Live), you can do so by running
\texttt{tinytex::tlmgr\_install(c("algorithms",\ "algorithmicx"))}

\begin{verbatim}
## tlmgr update --all --self
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## tlmgr install algorithms algorithmicx
\end{verbatim}

Copernicus staff will no accept any additional packages from your LaTeX
source code, so please stick to these two acceptable packages. They are
needed to use the example below

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
\IF {$i\geq 5$} 
        \STATE $i\gets i-1$
\ELSE
        \IF {$i\leq 3$}
                \STATE $i\gets i+2$
        \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{CHEMICAL FORMULAS AND REACTIONS}

For formulas embedded in the text, please use
\texttt{\textbackslash{}chem\{\}}, e.g. \chem{A \rightarrow B}.

The reaction environment creates labels including the letter R, i.e.
(R1), (R2), etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}rightarrow} should be used for normal
  (one-way) chemical reactions
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}rightleftharpoons} should be used for
  equilibria
\item
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}leftrightarrow} should be used for resonance
  structures
\end{itemize}

\begin{reaction}
A \rightarrow B \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Coper \rightleftharpoons nicus \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Publi \leftrightarrow cations
\end{reaction}

\subsection{PHYSICAL UNITS}

Please use \texttt{\textbackslash{}unit\{\}} (allows to save the
math/\texttt{\$} environment) and apply the exponential notation, for
example \(3.14\,\unit{km\,h^{-1}}\) (using LaTeX mode:
\texttt{\textbackslash{}(\ 3.14\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}unit\{...\}\ \textbackslash{})})
or \unit{0.872\,m\,s^{-1}} (using only
\texttt{\textbackslash{}unit\{0.872\textbackslash{},m\textbackslash{},s\^{}\{-1\}\}}).
