New insights into the Weddell Sea Ecosystem applying a network approach

Objectives
Describe the complexity and structure of the most highly-resolved Antarctic food web considering
unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (interaction strength-based) analyses.

Research questions
* Do unweighted and weighted network approaches highlight different aspects
of the food web structure?
* Does the energy of the food web flows in a compartmentalized or diffusive way?
* Are our network approaches able to distinguish 'keystone species' in the food web?

Hypotheses
We hypothesize that weighted analyses provide a clearer understanding of the energy fluxes 
and species ecological roles than the unweighted ones.
We hypothesize that the energy flow of the ecosystem is compartmentalized in distinct modules.
We hypothesize that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a 'keystone species'. Any other suggestion?

Methodology
Unweighted and node- and link-weighted network metrics.
Metrics: connectance, generality, vulnerability, trophic level, omnivory, modularity.
