New insights into the Weddell Sea Ecosystem applying a network approach

Objectives
Describe the complexity and structure of the most highly-resolved Antarctic food web considering
un-weighted (topology-based) and weighted (interaction strength-based) analyses.

Research questions
* Do un-weighted and weighted network approaches highlight different aspects
of the food web structure?
* Does the energy of the food web flows in a compartmentalized or diffusive way?
* Are our network approaches able to distinguish 'keystone species' in the food web?

Hypotheses
We hypothesize that weighted analyses provide a clearer understanding of the energy fluxes 
and species ecological roles than the un-weighted ones.
We hypothesize that the energy flow of the ecosystem is compartmentalized in distinct modules.
We hypothesize that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a 'keystone species'. Any other suggestion?
