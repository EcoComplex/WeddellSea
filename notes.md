fluctuations in the availability of basal resources are directly reflected in the structure of the food web, given the trophic plasticity of its constituent species43. Here, in response to these changes, consumers specialised on the abundant basal resources after their seasonal release. This is in agreement with what has been observed spatially5,7 and temporally18,43 in some polar species. It is also consistent with what is expected from the foraging optimisation theory44,45 and what has been observed at the food web level in aquatic communities at lower latitudes13,43,46.

In recent years, there has been a shift away from the long-standing paradigm in which a short, krill-dominated food chain was considered to be the central element in Southern Ocean food webs. Instead, there is now increasing recognition that alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups (mesopelagic fish and squid) may be equally (if not more) important than the krill pathway in many regions. Ecosystem models are a valuable tool to synthesise existing data on the structure of marine food webs and to visualise and quantify alternative energy pathways. In this study we develop a static mass balance food web model for the southern Kerguelen Axis region (Prydz Bay and Princess Elizabeth Trough) to evaluate the importance of alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups, including fish, squid and krill, in maintaining energy flow to top predators within East Antarctica. Our model reveals several major trophic pathways distinct from, and equally important to the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) pathway. Using simple scenarios of reductions in krill biomass, we investigate how the system might switch to a state dominated by fish and squid pathways with the response of krill-reliant predators strongly dependent on their ability to switch to other prey sources. We conclude by discussing what these findings might suggest for the future vulnerability of East Antarctic food webs and the implications for future modelling work in the region.

High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on
the planet 1 . Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice
loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting 2–4 . Here,
we show that, within their main population centre in the south-
west Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba
(hereafter, ‘krill’) has contracted southward over the past
90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have
declined sharply and the population has become more concen-
trated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase
in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile
krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruit-
ment, including a reduced density of juveniles following posi-
tive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies
are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and
reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and
the survival of larval krill 5 . However, the total post-larval den-
sity has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, sug-
gesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The
changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred
food web 6 and may affect biogeochemical cycling 7,8 . Rapid
climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the
roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems 3 .

We want to study the effect of modularity on stability. Therefore, we contrast the value for the real part of the ‘rightmost’ eigenvalue of M, Re(lM,1), with Reðl ~ M;1Þ, the value found for e M, a matrix with exactly the same coefficients, but re-arranged according to a random network structure (Q ¼ 0). Re(lM,1), is a measure of stability, as it expresses the amount of self-regulation we would need to stabilize the equilibrium

In the next section, we will see that this was an excellent idea, as the actual details of the distribution do not matter in the limit of S large (Tao et al. 2010). The only important quantities in this case are the mean and the variance of the distribution.

When an equilibrium point becomes unstable, however, the system could respond in different manners: it could start cycling, move towards another attractor, lose a few species through a transcritical bifurcation, or experience more dramatic changes—such as in the case of a ‘‘fold’’ bifurcation. May’s results would be more of a paradox if bifurcations were invariably to lead to large effects on biodiversity. On the other hand, if most bifurcations were to have small effects on the number of species, we could have systems persisting at the stability/ instability boundary, as hypothesized by Sole ́ et al. (2002). The immigration of new species would trigger limited extinctions, setting the system again close to the bifurcation. In this scenario, the stability criteria would accurately predict the number of extant species.

The distribution of species abundances, typically showing a large number of rare species (Magurran 2003), remains an important problem in ecology, and this generalized Lotka–Volterra model shows that the particular shape of the distribution is going to affect the stability of the ecological community.

Within a system of a given complexity, commonly only a few strong species interactions are present with most interactions being weak (e.g. Bascompte et al., 2005; Berlow et al., 2004; Paine, 1992; Wootton & Emmerson, 2005), though still being important for system stability (e.g. Kadoya et al., 2018; McCann et al., 1998; O'Gorman & Emmerson, 2009). Moreover, there is some evidence indicating that generalists (i.e. species with many possible interacting partners) mostly have weak interactions, while specialist species (i.e. fewer possible interacting partners) show stronger interactions (Wootton & Stouffer, 2016).

To select the best model we calculated the corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AIC c ) and Akaike weights
for each model [@Burnham2011]. Akaike weights (w i ) are the weight of evidence in favour of model i being the best model
among the candidate set of N models.

The continental shelf of the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) is still largely unprotected. This region is one of the most pristine and relatively unexplored hotspots of marine biodiversity in Antarctica, and it is less affected by sea surface warming compared with other, more exposed, areas as the Antarctic Peninsula (Teschke et al., 2016). Under a climate change scenario, Griffiths et al. (2017) hypothesized that the Weddell Sea continental shelf will be likely a sink area for species’ range shifts and a feasible refugium for highly cold-adapted benthic organisms.

Specifically, recent theoretical studies proved that both the architecture of the ecological networks and the distribution of interaction strengths impact ecosystem stability (Allesina & Tang 2012; Loreau & de Mazancourt 2013).

@Allesina2015

We find that intervality and broad degree distributions tend to stabilize food webs, and that average interaction strength has little influence on stability, compared with the effect of variance and correlation.

hese self-effects are known as 'self-regulation' when an increase in a species’ abundance decreases its per-capita growth rate. Sources of self-regulation include intraspecific interference, cannibalism, time-scale separation between consumers and their resources, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear functional responses coupling predators with their prey. The influence of self-regulation on network stability is understudied and in addition, the empirical estimation of self-effects poses a formidable challenge. Here, we show that empirical food web structures cannot be stabilized unless the majority of species exhibit substantially strong self-regulation.

It must be recognised that if density dependence, that is, the negative effect of a population density on its own per capita growth rate—is an important driving factor for the dynamics of a population, or if trophic interaction strength is weak, then indirect effects may become weaker or even trivial (Abrams et al., 1996); one could then simply consider the direct effects of stressors. Still, there is ample empirical evidence for trophically mediated indirect effects and for the propagation of the effects of stressors through food webs (e.g. O’Gorman & Emmerson, 2009; Estes et al., 2011; O’Gorman et al., 2012). Furthermore, we would also expect indirect effects of the same direction and type if density dependence was weaker or stronger. Given the aim of our study, that is, to understand the propagation of stressors through species interactions, we thus intentionally focus on instances where density dependence is not the regulating factor for population and community dynamics.
