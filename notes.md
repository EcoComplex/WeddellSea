fluctuations in the availability of basal resources are directly reflected in the structure of the food web, given the trophic plasticity of its constituent species43. Here, in response to these changes, consumers specialised on the abundant basal resources after their seasonal release. This is in agreement with what has been observed spatially5,7 and temporally18,43 in some polar species. It is also consistent with what is expected from the foraging optimisation theory44,45 and what has been observed at the food web level in aquatic communities at lower latitudes13,43,46.

In recent years, there has been a shift away from the long-standing paradigm in which a short, krill-dominated food chain was considered to be the central element in Southern Ocean food webs. Instead, there is now increasing recognition that alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups (mesopelagic fish and squid) may be equally (if not more) important than the krill pathway in many regions. Ecosystem models are a valuable tool to synthesise existing data on the structure of marine food webs and to visualise and quantify alternative energy pathways. In this study we develop a static mass balance food web model for the southern Kerguelen Axis region (Prydz Bay and Princess Elizabeth Trough) to evaluate the importance of alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups, including fish, squid and krill, in maintaining energy flow to top predators within East Antarctica. Our model reveals several major trophic pathways distinct from, and equally important to the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) pathway. Using simple scenarios of reductions in krill biomass, we investigate how the system might switch to a state dominated by fish and squid pathways with the response of krill-reliant predators strongly dependent on their ability to switch to other prey sources. We conclude by discussing what these findings might suggest for the future vulnerability of East Antarctic food webs and the implications for future modelling work in the region.

High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on
the planet 1 . Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice
loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting 2–4 . Here,
we show that, within their main population centre in the south-
west Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba
(hereafter, ‘krill’) has contracted southward over the past
90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have
declined sharply and the population has become more concen-
trated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase
in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile
krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruit-
ment, including a reduced density of juveniles following posi-
tive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies
are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and
reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and
the survival of larval krill 5 . However, the total post-larval den-
sity has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, sug-
gesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The
changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred
food web 6 and may affect biogeochemical cycling 7,8 . Rapid
climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the
roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems 3 .
