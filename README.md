## Abstract

The Weddell Sea food web is one of the most highly-resolved networks for high-latitude marine ecosystems. We applied a network approach to analyze this food web at three levels: global, sub-network and species. The network comprises 435 species and 1978 interactions with 4.55 interactions per species on average. It presents a small-world topology, where species are connected by short paths and its clustering coefficient is higher than randomly expected. Most of the species interact by means of exploitative competition, where predators compete for the same resource. Network indices at the species level show that the keystone species are: Salpa thompsoni (salp), Odontaster validus (sea star) and Euphausia superba (krill). These results coincide with previous studies where pelagic species, krill and salps, play a pivotal role in the Weddell Sea. Complementary, we show the importance of benthic species, sea star, in the structure and function of the ecosystem. We conclude that the network approach provides new insight in complex and, already well-studied, systems.
